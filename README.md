<h1>Death Dealt Hand</h1>
<p>is a short playing card game that introduces a twist to the traditional italian card game of scopa. This is done by infusing horror elements to an otherwise calming experience through fine tunned lighting and post processing effects as well as carefully selected sound effects and ambiance. Inspired by games such as Buckshot Roulette and Inscription, we aimed to create a chilling but memorable game that brings a unique vibe to the playing card table.</p>
