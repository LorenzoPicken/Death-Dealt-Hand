<h1>Death Dealt Hand</h1>
<p>is a short playing card game that introduces a twist to the traditional italian card game of Scopa. This is done by infusing horror elements into an otherwise calming experience through fine tunned lighting and post processing effects as well as carefully selected sound effects and ambiance. Inspired by games such as Buckshot Roulette and Inscription, we aimed to create a chilling but memorable game that brings a unique vibe to the playing card table. This game was a collaborative work made in unity by a team of three programmers as a final project.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Death Dealt Hand's gameplay is simple and breaks down into three main systems that work in unison to deliver the final coherent experience. These three systems are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LorenzoPicken/Death-Dealt-Hand/edit/main/README.md#">The Table</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">The Opponent</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">The Effect Deck</a></li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3>The Table</h3>
<p>The Table is the name that we gave to the dealer or more accurately, the game manager. Responsible for overseeing the game state and tracking important values, the table provides crutial information to various other systems which allows them to perform important procedures. Information such as score, player turns, deck size, available table slots, etc, are all accounted for by this manager. Additionally, it is also responsible for executing tasks such as distributing cards, shuffling the deck and calculating points.</p>
